# Structural Mechanics / Math Heuristics

- Introduce a hidden variable that gates a secret ending.
- Use two coupled metrics that trade off (A rises when B falls).
- Require a minimum number of unique encounter types.
- Force one irreversible decision per arc.
- Add a delayed consequence that resolves after N turns.
- Add a conservation rule to keep totals bounded.
- Use a hidden gate that requires 2 prior spools.
