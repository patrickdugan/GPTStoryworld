# Myth-History to Math Overlay

Use these overlays to translate narrative patterns into structural mechanics.

## Legitimacy Crises
- Spool: "Claim to Authority" arc
- Hidden variable: public trust threshold
- Secret ending: legitimacy restored if trust and reform both pass

## Schism and Interpretation
- Two spools in tension; require a cross-spool reconciliation option
- Use coupled variables for orthodoxy vs innovation

## Reform Cycles
- Delayed consequence: reform backlash after N turns
- Irreversible choice: codify reform or preserve tradition

## Institutional Deadlock
- Add a mediator faction; gate resolution on negotiation actions
- Use a conserved influence pool across factions

## Public vs Elite
- Hidden option reveals public sentiment; needed for secret ending
- Require minimum unique encounters with public-facing choices
