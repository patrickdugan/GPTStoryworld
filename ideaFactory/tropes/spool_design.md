# Spools, Hidden Options, and Secret Endings

- Spools represent arcs; tie them to thematic variables.
- Use connected_spools to signal cross-arc dependencies.
- Hidden options should be discoverable via prior choices.
- Secret endings should require 2+ independent conditions.
- Use one spool as a false lead to test discernment.
- Gate a spool on a variable that is never directly shown.
