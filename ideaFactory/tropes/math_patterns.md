# Math Patterns for Storyworld Design

- Use coupled variables A and B with a tradeoff curve.
- Gate a secret ending on a hidden boolean plus a threshold.
- Require a minimum number of unique encounters per arc.
- Add a delayed effect that triggers after N turns.
- Use irreversible choices to create path dependence.
- Add a conservation rule: total influence is fixed and redistributed.
- Introduce a noisy metric that can only be inferred, not observed.
- Make one variable monotonic and one oscillatory.
